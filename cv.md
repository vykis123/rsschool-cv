**About**: At the moment I'm serving in military as an officer. I started to learn coding couple years ago, from one small course in udemy about HTML and CSS3. So after that I took another one and another one in Udemy, about HTML, CSS, JS and most recently React. Naturaly I can only learn after work or on weekends, so the proccess is a bit longer but I like it, so the motivation is allways high; 
*May main goal for now is to get a job as a Front-end developer* . My contract with military ends this year on August 7th, so I am looking for a open job possitions at this momet in oder to find one, or to see what I need to improve to get hired; 
**What I know**:
- HTML;
- CSS;
- JS;
- SASS;
- REACT.
- Had some interaction with TypeScript, but not realy deep dive so far.
**Work example**: My latest code example probaly would come from the React course, from one of the projects which I have on netlify. [Example](https://first-react-app-quo.netlify.app) ;
**Work experience**: For now I didn't had the opportunity to work somewhere related to IT. So my experience from courses and self found free projects. At the moment I don't have portfolio website, to share with you. Only some projects on netlify, if you would be interested;
**Courses**: For now i have finished these courses:
- React – the Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router,Redux);
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Build 6 Creative Projects;
- 20 Web Projects With Vanila JavScript; The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!;
- PHP for Beginners;

**English**: In military we do english tests to check the level of soldiers 1 time in 2 years. Plus I was learning english during my bachelor studies. In my master studies I was using english, when writing articles and so on. In military I use english daily, when communicating with people from other countries. So I never had any issues with it. It was a suprise, to see test result of A2, but no problem here, because I know that english is not my weak point :grin:
