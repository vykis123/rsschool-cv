**English**: In military we do english tests to check the level of soldiers 1 time in 2 years. Plus I was learning english during my bachelor studies. In my master studies I was using english, when writing articles and so on. In military I use english daily, when communicating with people from other countries. So I never had any issues with it. It was a suprise, to see test result of A2, but no problem here, because I know that english is not my weak point :grin:
